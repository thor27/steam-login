KNOWN ISSUES
------------

Steam, sometimes, may "hide" itself, mostly when something went wrong with a game or staem itself. If this happens just press ALT+TAB to get back do Steam Big Picture. (**this will likely not happens in version 10**)

INSTALL
-------
You can download deb packges from here:  <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0E1Hoh3ktodYnk4NF9VY1dnblE?usp=sharing">Steam Login</a>

**The PPA is really outdated**, and I'm not much inclined to maitain it anymore. If
anything changes I will update here.
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:thor27-gmail/steam-desktop
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install steam-login
```

On Arch you can install this by installing <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/steam-session-git/">steam-session-git</a> on the AUR.

HACKING ON IT
-------------
It's a pretty simple project.

You just need to put the correct files on steam-login or stea-login-hacked folder, as if was your / folder. on DEBIAN control you may change version dependencies and stuff

To build the package you just need to run the build.sh script:

```
./build.sh
```

Please fork-it and improve it :)
